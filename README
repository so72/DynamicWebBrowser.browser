Dynamic Web Browser - WIP

Feel free to add notes to this file.

I'll layout what I think this project should look like,
and hopefully split it into even work in the process.
Feel free to take on any part you choose.

The Browser part:
    - For now should just have a address bar and a 'go' button
        maybe we can add back/forward buttons later. Not a requirement.
    - Ability to display HTML
    - Gets a protocol from httpClassLoader
    - Calls execute on that protocol
    - Displays resulting HTML string

The Protocols:
    - http - located in the browser project (don't dynamically load it)
    - time - simple

The Server part:
    - Needs to respond to 'CLASS' and 'GET' requests
    - Just serves class files
    - Protocols are implemented here (except for http)
